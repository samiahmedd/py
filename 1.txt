Organizational transformations have been part of organizational life for many years. There are reorganizations, big IT transformations and nowadays Agile, Cloud, digital, or DevOps transformations. These transformations used to follow a familiar pattern: an organization is going through a major transformation and invests significant amounts of money over a 3-5 year horizon into the transformation. At the end of the transformation when the "end-state" was achieved, the level of investment got reduced and focus shifted to stabilization and cost reduction. Over time the requirements changed more than the current level of investment allowed us to adapt for. Technical debt and the gap between needs and system functionality increased until this reached a level that required significant reinvestment or a new transformation to the next trend.
